### Hello!

💬 About me:
- A die-hard Harry Potter fan. My favorite characters are Regulus Black and Ron Weasley. Those who show bravery always deeply touch me. By the way, we might have a little debate if you're a Draco fan or a Snape fan. :-)  
- 一个很严格的“的/地/得”和“不以为意/不以为然”小警察. 
- I firmly believe that passion, critical thinking, dedication and perseverance are the most important factors.

🔭 ~~I'm looking for a PhD position in AIoT and related fields.~~ I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in HKUST CSE for Fall 2025.
