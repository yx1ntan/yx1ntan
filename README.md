### Hello!

ðŸ”­ ~~I'm looking for a PhD position in AIoT and related fields.~~ I'm an incoming Ph.D. student in HKUST CSE for Fall 2025.

In my view, the idea of an "information gap" might not truly exist. The real difference lies in *how we search for information and leverage tools that go beyond traditional search engines*. In a world where information is abundant and easily accessible, the ability to navigate and utilize diverse resources effectively becomes the critical factor. LLMs highlight this distinction. 

Sometimes, I feel really frustrated with my work because Iâ€™ve put in so much time and effort to make things better, but it still doesnâ€™t turn out the way I want. Whenever that happens, I come back to this lineâ€”these wordsâ€”to remind myself that Iâ€™ll be better every time I try!
