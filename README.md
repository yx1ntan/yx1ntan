In my view, the idea of an "information gap" might not truly exist. The real difference lies in *how we search for information and leverage tools that go beyond traditional search engines*. In a world where information is abundant and easily accessible, the ability to navigate and utilize diverse resources effectively becomes the critical factor. LLMs highlight this distinction.
