### Hello!

💬 About me:
- A die-hard Harry Potter fan. My favorite characters are Regulus Black, Dobby and Ron Weasley. Those who show bravery always deeply touch me. By the way, we might argue if you're a Draco fan. :-)
- 一个很严格的“的/地/得”和“不以为意/不以为然”小警察. 
- I firmly believe that courage, curiosity, perseverance, and working with exceptional people are the most important things.
